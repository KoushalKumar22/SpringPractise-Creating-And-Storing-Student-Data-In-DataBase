NOTE : This program uses mariadb Dependency.

Heloo to springboot, This is my first program using sql in springboot which stores some basic student data like name age roll no.


Some changes you have to do in the program are to run on your system are :-

<1>: go to  src/main/resources/application.properties    and change your databse name  ( spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/( Your database name ) 

<2>: in the same file change your password to your mariadb password  ( spring.datasource.password= ( your password )


THE PROGRAM IS TESTED AND VERIFIED ON POSTMAN AND ON ANY BROWSER.
